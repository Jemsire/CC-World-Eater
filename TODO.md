List of things i want to get to at some point.
These will change as the project goes on and is more of a notes section for myself than anything.
Most other ideas from contributers and the community will be inside the issues area.

List:
- add monitor prompts for update tasks and display confirms and warnings there. Allow major update to be prompted on there. Basically clear screen and display a progress bar and info there so you know when an update or action has actually triggered and if its working. Good way to visualize errors as well. Will need a bit of a rework on the monitor system.
- add a manual update to the turtles of placed next to the drive. This currently does not work as intitialize task can break and the turtle can trigger an update without being initialized. Will look at redoing the order or checks at some other point. Basically when turtle turns on, if next to disk drive, ask hub for update and update before intializing hopefully without a boot loop. Maybe actually use the UPDATED flag file that does not really do much currently.
